Smarty Unit Testing
-------------------

Smarty unit tests require the PEAR PHPUnit
package to be installed. See if you have that
installed with the following command:

$> pear list

If you don't see PHPUnit, install with this:

$> pear install PHPUnit

Edit the config.php file,
be sure everything is defined correctly.

Be sure the following directories are present:

templates
configs
templates_c (writable)
cache (writable)

Then run from the command line:
php -q smarty_unit_test.php

Or from the web browser:
http://www.your_domain.com/path/to/smarty_unit_test_gui.php

This will run a unit test for every component
of Smarty and dump the results. All should pass
with flying colors. :)
