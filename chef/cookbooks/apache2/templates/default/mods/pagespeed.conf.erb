    # PassThrough, CoreFilters and TestingCoreFilters.
    #
    # ModPagespeedRewriteLevel PassThrough

    # Explicitly disables specific filters. This is useful in
    # conjuction with ModPagespeedRewriteLevel. For instance, if one
    # of the filters in the CoreFilters needs to be disabled for a
    # site, that filter can be added to
    # ModPagespeedDisableFilters. This directive contains a

    # ModPagespeedDomain
    # authorizes rewriting of JS, CSS, and Image files found in this
    # domain. By default only resources with the same origin as the
    # HTML file are rewritten. For example:
    #
    #   ModPagespeedDomain cdn.myhost.com
    #
    # This will allow resources found on http://cdn.myhost.com to be
    # rewritten in addition to those in the same domain as the HTML.
    #
    # Wildcards (* and ?) are allowed in the domain specification. Be
    # careful when using them as if you rewrite domains that do not
    # send you traffic, then the site receiving the traffic will not
    # know how to serve the rewritten content.

    # You can also customize the number of threads per Apache process
    # mod_pagespeed will use to do resource optimization. Plain
    # "rewrite threads" are used to do short, latency-sensitive work,

    # work that's more computationally expensive. If you live these unset,
    # or use values <= 0 the defaults will be used, which is 1 for both
    # values when using non-threaded MPMs (e.g. prefork) and 4 for both
    # on threaded MPMs (e.g. worker and event). These settings can only

    # When Apache is set up as a browser proxy, mod_pagespeed can record
    # web-sites as they are requested, so that an image of the web is built up
