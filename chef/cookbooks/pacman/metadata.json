{"name":"pacman","description":"Updates package list for pacman and has LWRP for pacman groups","long_description":"[![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/jesseadams/pacman.png)](https://travis-ci.org/jesseadams/pacman)\n\nDESCRIPTION\n===========\n\nRefreshes the pacman package cache from the FTP servers and provides LWRPs related to pacman\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n============\n\nPlatform: ArchLinux. Pacman is not relevant on other platforms.\n\nRESOURCES\n=========\n\n`pacman_group`\n--------------\n\nUse the `pacman_group` resource to install or remove pacman package groups. Note that at this time the LWRP will check if the group is installed but doesn't do a lot of error checking or handling. File a ticket on the COOK project at tickets.opscode.com for improvements and feature requests.\n\nThe `options` parameter can be used to pass arbitrary options to the pacman command.\n\n`pacman_aur`\n------------\n\nUse the `pacman_aur` resource to install packages from ArchLinux's AUR repository.\n\n### Actions:\n\n* :build - Builds the package.\n* :install - Installs the built package.\n\n### Parameters:\n\n* version - hardcode a version\n* builddir - specify an alternate build directory, defaults to `Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]/builds`.\n* options - pass arbitrary options to the pacman command.\n* `pkgbuild_src` - whether to use an included PKGBUILD file, put the PKGBUILD file in in the `files/default` directory.\n* patches - array of patch names, as files in `files/default` that should be applied for the package.\n\nhttp://aur.archlinux.org/\n\nUSAGE\n=====\n\nInclude `recipe[pacman]` early in the run list, preferably first, to ensure that the package caches are updated before trying to install new packages.\n\n\nLICENSE AND AUTHOR\n==================\n\nAuthor:: Joshua Timberman (<joshua@opscode.com>)\n\nMaintainer:: Jesse R.
