[![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/jesseadams/pacman.png)](https://travis-ci.org/jesseadams/pacman)

DESCRIPTION
===========

Refreshes the pacman package cache from the FTP servers and provides LWRPs related to pacman

REQUIREMENTS
============

Platform: ArchLinux. Pacman is not relevant on other platforms.

RESOURCES
=========

`pacman_group`
--------------

Use the `pacman_group` resource to install or remove pacman package groups. Note that at this time the LWRP will check if the group is installed but doesn't do a lot of error checking or handling. File a ticket on the COOK project at tickets.opscode.com for improvements and feature requests.

The `options` parameter can be used to pass arbitrary options to the pacman command.

`pacman_aur`
------------

Use the `pacman_aur` resource to install packages from ArchLinux's AUR repository.

### Actions:

* :build - Builds the package.
* :install - Installs the built package.

### Parameters:

* version - hardcode a version
* builddir - specify an alternate build directory, defaults to `Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]/builds`.
* options - pass arbitrary options to the pacman command.
* `pkgbuild_src` - whether to use an included PKGBUILD file, put the PKGBUILD file in in the `files/default` directory.
* patches - array of patch names, as files in `files/default` that should be applied for the package.

USAGE
=====

Include `recipe[pacman]` early in the run list, preferably first, to ensure that the package caches are updated before trying to install new packages.
