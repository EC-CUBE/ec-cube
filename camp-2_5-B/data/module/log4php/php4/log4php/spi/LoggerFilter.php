 * log4php is a PHP port of the log4j java logging package.
 * 
 * <p>This framework is based on log4j (see {@link http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j log4j} for details).</p>
 * <p>Design, strategies and part of the methods documentation are developed by log4j team 
 * (Ceki Gülcü as log4j project founder and 
 * {@link http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/contributors.html contributors}).</p>

/**
 * Users should extend this class to implement customized logging
 * event filtering. Note that {@link LoggerCategory} and {@link LoggerAppenderSkeleton}, 
 * the parent class of all standard
 * appenders, have built-in filtering rules. It is suggested that you
 * first use and understand the built-in rules before rushing to write
 * your own custom filters.
 * 
 * <p>This abstract class assumes and also imposes that filters be
 * organized in a linear chain. The {@link #decide
 * decide(LoggerLoggingEvent)} method of each filter is called sequentially,
 * in the order of their addition to the chain.
 * 
 * <p>The {@link decide()} method must return one
 * of the integer constants {@link LOG4PHP_LOG4PHP_LOGGER_FILTER_DENY}, 
 * {@link LOG4PHP_LOGGER_FILTER_NEUTRAL} or {@link LOG4PHP_LOGGER_FILTER_ACCEPT}.
 * 
 * <p>If the value {@link LOG4PHP_LOGGER_FILTER_DENY} is returned, then the log event is
 * dropped immediately without consulting with the remaining
 * filters. 
 * 
 * <p>If the value {@link LOG4PHP_LOGGER_FILTER_NEUTRAL} is returned, then the next filter
 * in the chain is consulted. If there are no more filters in the
 * chain, then the log event is logged. Thus, in the presence of no
 * filters, the default behaviour is to log all logging events.
 * 
 * <p>If the value {@link LOG4PHP_LOGGER_FILTER_ACCEPT} is returned, then the log
 * event is logged without consulting the remaining filters. 
 * 
 * <p>The philosophy of log4php filters is largely inspired from the
 * Linux ipchains.
